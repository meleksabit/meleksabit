🌐 About Me:

I’m a passionate Dev(Sec)Ops Engineer with a sharp focus on security. My mission is to craft secure, scalable pipelines while diving deep into the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity, which fuels my passion and curiosity. From coding to containers and AI to automation, I thrive on building cutting-edge solutions that merge development efficiency with airtight security.

Whether it's writing clean code in Python, deploying Kubernetes clusters, or leveraging AI models to bring machine learning into production, I always keep security at the heart of everything I do. I’m driven by the belief that innovation and security should go hand in hand, and I’m always exploring new ways to elevate both.
